**4xLSDIRCompact**

Meant for 4x photo upscaling.

This was the first model I had fully trained and released. It grew over time, meaning I changed training configs and trained some more, therefore there are 3 versions I had released. It is recommended to use *version 3* as this had been the most trained model files (86+ hours) you can find the models in the subfolders.
