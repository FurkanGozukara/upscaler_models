**Description:** My first ever model ðŸ˜€ Well, itâ€™s not the best, but, itâ€™s something ;) 
I provide some 15 examples from the validation set here for you to visually see the generated output (with chaiNNer), photo dimensions are in the name: https://imgsli.com/MTYxNDk3

**Model Architecture:** SRVGG  
**Scale:** 4  
**Purpose:** Upscale small  photos with compression to 4x their size  

**Iterations:** 190000  
**batch_size:** Variable(1-10)  
**HR_size:** 256  
**Dataset:** LSDIR  
**Dataset_size:** 84991  
**OTF Training** No  
**Pretrained_Model_G:** 4xLSDIRCompact.pth  

**Description:** Trying to extend my previous model to be able to handle compression (JPG 100-30) by manually altering the training dataset, since 4xLSDIRCompact1 cant handle compression. Use this instead of 4xLSDIRCompact1 if your photo has compression (like an image from the web).

**License:** CC BY 4.0  
**Model Architecture:** SRVGG  
**Scale:** 4  
**Purpose:** Upscale small photos with compression, noise and slight blur to 4x their size

**Iterations:** 130000  
**batch_size:** Variable(1-5)  
**HR_size:** 256  
**Dataset:** LSDIR  
**Dataset_size:** 84991  
**OTF Training** Yes  
**Pretrained_Model_G:** 4xLSDIRCompact.pth  

**Description:** Extending my last 4xLSDIRCompact1 model to Real-ESRGAN, meaning trained on synthetic data instead to handle more kinds of degradations, it should be able to handle compression, noise, and slight blur.

Here is a comparison to show that 4xLSDIRCompact1 cannot handle compression artifacts, and that these two models will produce better output for that specific scenario. These models are not â€˜betterâ€™ than the previous one, they are just meant to handle a different use case: https://imgsli.com/MTYyODY3
