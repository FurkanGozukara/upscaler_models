These are results of models trained on the same dataset HFA2kLUDVAE for anime sr with realistic degradations (compression, noise, blur). Visual outputs as well as inference times and metrics on the validation dataset.

I never released SFAMN as a model because as can be seen in the visual outputs, it had a tendency to generate weird artifacts.

The _gt128 models were older versions, basically trained on gt_size 128 for me to compare them against each other since training goes faster than with higher gt. If i like a model, I will increase this to get better results and release the further trained model.
