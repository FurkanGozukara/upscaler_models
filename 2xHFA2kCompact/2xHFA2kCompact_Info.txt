My second complete model

Name: 2xHFA2kCompact
License: CC BY 4.0
Model Files: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iW4EHokEsrcIZ7He5g485kvmPKXGk1EV
Network: SRVGGNetCompact, with parameters: 600,652
Scale: 2
Purpose: A compact anime 2x upscaling model based on musl's HFA2k dataset

Iterations: 93,000
batch_size: 12
HR_size: 384
Epoch: 207 (require iter number per epoch: 214)
Dataset: HFA2k
Number of train images: 2568
OTF Training: Yes
Pretrained_Model_G: 4x_Compact_Pretrain
Training time: 24h+

Description: Compact 2x anime upscaler with otf compression and blur. The '2xHFA2kCompact.pth' (4.6 MB) is the original trained model file, the other model files are conversions using chaiNNer. Trained on musl's latest dataset release for Anime SISR, which has been extracted from modern anime films, where the selection criteria was high SNR, no DOF and high frequency information.

Future work: Started training a 4xRRDBNet version of this, bigger model so maybe better results but slower, for still/ single anime images. Will release in the future or drop, based on achieved results.
